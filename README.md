# Sealife Website

## Introduction
The project is a frontend-only responsive website for a university assignment serving as an MVP for a startup focused on restoring marine flora by selling and planting corals.

## Description
The website started as a Figma design (wireframes and mockups) and then was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5, and JavaScript. 
It's a frontend project only.
